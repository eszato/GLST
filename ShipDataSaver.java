						at time A a ship is going to warp, but has yet to engageWarpDrive.
						after the ship reaches its destination, it is then ordered to
						warp again. call this time B.
						
						If, after time B, the ship must load data back to time A, the ship will have
						the wrong exit_vec_len because it will have the value it is planning
						to use for its second jump instead of the one it needs to compute arrival
						time for its first. So in order to get a coordination bug here, the shortest possible
						warp time in the galaxy (plus the amount of time to exit warp and issue another
						warp order) must be shorter than the amount we have to step back.
						
						A bit more to the point: exit_vec_len is computed by orderToWarp and
						consumed by engageWarpDrive.  In order to have a problem, we must step back
						from after an orderToWarp to before the last engageWarpDrive.  UNLIKELY.  But possible?
						Well, I suppose, if someone makes a twin system or we allow some sort of wormhole later.*/
